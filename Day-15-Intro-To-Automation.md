# Day 15: Intro to AI Automation
**Project:** Building the "Hands" for KreyolAIHub

### The Concept
I learned the core principle of AI Engineering: **Trigger → Action**. Instead of manual chatting, I am now designing workflows where events in the real world (like a Google Form submission) trigger AI responses automatically.

### The Tech Stack
- **Make.com:** My primary automation hub.
- **Google Sheets:** My "Database" for community inputs.
- **Gemini/Claude API:** The "Brain" that processes the data.

### Logic Design
I am building a "Parent Support Bot" logic. It catches new questions, processes them through an AI cultural filter, and drafts a Kreyòl response. I've also identified 'Filters' (like checking for empty data) to ensure the automation doesn't break.
