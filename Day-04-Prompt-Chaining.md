# Day 4: Prompt Chaining & Multi-Step Workflows
**Project:** KreyolAIHub Automated Content Stream

### The Strategy
Instead of one "Mega-Prompt," I used **Prompt Chaining** to ensure higher quality at every stage. By separating the Math, the Professional Writing, and the Social Media Marketing, the AI stays focused and avoids "instruction neglect."

### The Workflow
1. **The Logic Link:** Calculated resource needs.
2. **The Professional Link:** Drafted a donor request email (English).
3. **The Cultural Link:** Created community outreach content (Kreyòl).

### Result
I can now turn a single set of data into an entire marketing and funding campaign in under 2 minutes.
