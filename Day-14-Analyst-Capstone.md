1️⃣ Data Table: Internet Access vs. Water Safety (Urban vs. Rural Haiti)
Location Type	Internet Access (2026)	Water Safety Status (2026)	Key Observations
Urban Schools	Moderate to High (stable mobile data, some fiber in cities)	Moderate Risk (intermittent contamination reports, aging infrastructure)	Connectivity exists but water systems are unreliable and poorly monitored.
Rural Schools	Low to Very Limited (weak cellular signal, no broadband)	High Risk (untreated sources, recent contamination findings)	Limited connectivity makes emergency reporting and water safety coordination difficult.

Summary Insight:
Rural schools face a compounded vulnerability — low connectivity and higher exposure to unsafe water sources.

2️⃣ Risk Assessment: Alcibiade School – Jacmel

Location: Jacmel
School: Alcibiade School

Top 2 Risks Identified

1️⃣ Microbial Contamination (Likely Fecal Bacteria Exposure)
Recent water quality findings suggest possible bacterial contamination. This creates high risk of:

Acute diarrheal illness

Cholera resurgence

Dehydration among younger students

2️⃣ Delayed Alert & Response Due to Weak Monitoring Systems
Without real-time reporting mechanisms:

Parents may remain uninformed

School administrators may delay closing contaminated water points

Outbreak response could be reactive instead of preventive

Overall Risk Level: HIGH (Immediate mitigation recommended)

3️⃣ The “Haiti-Resilient” Technical Solution
📲 Proposed Tool: Low-Bandwidth WhatsApp Alert Bot

A centralized WhatsApp-based safety alert bot that:

Allows school administrators to send instant contamination alerts

Works on basic smartphones

Sends automated voice notes in Haitian Kreyòl

Stores reports in a lightweight cloud dashboard

Operates in low-bandwidth environments

Why WhatsApp?

Widely used in Haiti

Requires minimal training

Compatible with limited data plans

Enables parent + teacher broadcast groups

Alternative for very low-connectivity rural zones:

Solar-powered offline micro-server (Raspberry Pi-based) syncing alerts when signal becomes available.
