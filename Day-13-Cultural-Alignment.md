# Day 13: Bias Detection & Cultural Alignment
**Project:** Localizing AI for the Haitian Context

### The Strategy
I learned to audit AI responses for "Western Bias." Instead of accepting generic plans, I force the AI to account for local variables like intermittent power, "pay-as-you-go" internet models, and mobile money (MonCash) ecosystems.

### Why this is a Specialist Skill
Generic AI advice can lead to wasted money and failed projects in Haiti. By applying a "Haiti-Resilient" filter, I ensure KreyolAIHub provides solutions that are actually implementable in our schools and towns.

### Key Awareness
- Infrastructure: Moving from 'Always-On' to 'Offline-First' logic.
- Finance: Moving from 'Subscription/Credit Card' to 'Local Payment' logic.
