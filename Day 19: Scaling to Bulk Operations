Technical Milestone: Upgraded the KreyolAI trigger logic from single-entry to batch processing by increasing the module Limit to 10.

System Hardening: Implemented an Error Handling directive (Ignore/Resume) to prevent scenario stoppage during RuntimeError events.

Efficiency: Optimized API calls by allowing the Gemini module to iterate through multiple bundles in a single execution cycle.
