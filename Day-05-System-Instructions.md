# Day 5: System Instructions & AI Personality
**Project:** Defining the KreyolAIHub Brand Voice

### The Strategy
I learned that you can "pre-program" an AI's behavior. Instead of repeating instructions, I define a **System Persona** that ensures the AI always respects Haitian culture and language.

### Why this matters for KreyolAIHub
Standard AI can feel "foreign." By using System Instructions, I make the technology feel local and accessible.

### Example Analogy Used
- **Topic:** Prompt Engineering
- **Analogy:** Comparing a prompt to a "Pass" in football. If the pass is bad, the striker (AI) can't score. You have to place the ball exactly where it needs to be.
