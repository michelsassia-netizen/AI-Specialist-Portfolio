# Day 3: Variable-Based Templates (Bilingual)
**Project:** KreyolAIHub School Water Manager

### The Goal
To build a reusable "Logic Engine" that handles Haitian Kreyòl inputs and produces professional bilingual reports.

### Key Specialist Skill: "The Sandwich Technique"
I learned to use English instructions for the AI's internal logic while allowing the user to interact in Kreyòl. This ensures mathematical accuracy while maintaining accessibility.

### Variables Used
- `[NAME]`: School Name
- `[STUDENT_COUNT]`: Total number of students
- `[LITERS_PER_STUDENT]`: Usage rate
- `[TANK_CAPACITY]`: Local infrastructure limits
