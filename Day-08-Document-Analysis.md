# Day 8: Deep Document Analysis
**Project:** Turning Long Reports into Community Action

### The Strategy
I moved beyond simple summaries. I learned how to use "Analytical Lenses" to extract specific data (Numbers, Risks, Local Impact) from long texts.

### Why this is a Specialist Skill
Standard users get overwhelmed by 50-page PDFs. An AI Specialist uses structured prompting to find the "Needle in the Haystack" in seconds.

### Result for KreyolAIHub
I can now take technical NGO reports and translate the *impact* directly into Kreyòl announcements for the community without losing the technical accuracy.
