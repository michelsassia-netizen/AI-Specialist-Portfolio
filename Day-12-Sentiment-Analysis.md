# Day 12: Sentiment & Trend Analysis
**Project:** Listening to the KreyolAIHub Community

### The Strategy
I used AI to process community feedback. Instead of just reading comments, I performed a "Sentiment Audit" to categorize the community's mood and identify specific "Pain Points" (like cost or scheduling).

### Why this is a Specialist Skill
Data is more than just numbers; it's emotions. A Specialist knows how to quantify "Community Pulse" so that the solutions we build actually solve the problems people care about most.

### Key Insight
By identifying worries early (e.g., concerns about meeting times), I can pivot my strategy before the community loses interest.
