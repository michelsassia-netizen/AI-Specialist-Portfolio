# Day 11: Advanced Web Research & Real-Time Intelligence
**Project:** Keeping KreyolAIHub Current

### The Strategy
I learned how to bypass AI "knowledge cutoffs" by using directed web research. I now use a triangulated approach, looking at local news, international reports, and official government data to get a 360-degree view of a situation.

### Why this is a Specialist Skill
Generic users get old info. A Specialist ensures their platform is based on **today's reality**. Whether it's the price of a solar panel or new educational policies in Haiti, I can find it and verify it.

### Case Study: Solar/Tech Infrastructure
- **Findings:** The Lead: Biggest Recent Headline

Haiti has officially launched the construction of a new photovoltaic solar power plant in Jacmel.
A 4 MW solar facility with a 6 MWh battery storage system — financed through the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program (SREP) and supported by the World Bank — is now moving from planning to implementation. The contract was signed in mid-January 2026 between the Haitian Ministry of Public Works and ESD Engineering Services S.R.L. from the Dominican Republic. This project aims to significantly strengthen grid-connected renewable power in the Southeast.

Why it matters: This is one of the most concrete and recent solar infrastructure developments in Haiti, marking a shift from planning to ground-level execution of utility-scale renewable generation.- **Impact:** This info helps KreyolAIHub pivot its strategy based on actual local developments.
