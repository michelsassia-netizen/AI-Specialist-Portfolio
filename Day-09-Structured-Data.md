# Day 9: Structured Data & CSV Generation
**Project:** Automating Resource Tracking for KreyolAIHub

### The Strategy
I learned how to force the AI to move from "conversational mode" to "data mode." By defining specific columns and logic rules (like Priority levels), I can transform messy notes into professional spreadsheets.

### Why this is a Specialist Skill
Most people just read what the AI says. A Specialist makes the AI produce **interoperable data**—files that can be moved into Excel, Trello, or SQL databases.

### Technical Output
- **Markdown Tables:** For clean visual reporting.
- **CSV Formatting:** For functional data exports.
