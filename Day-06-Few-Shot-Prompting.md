# Day 6: Few-Shot Prompting
**Project:** Standardizing the KreyolAIHub Voice

### The Strategy
I used "Few-Shot" techniques to train the AI on my specific communication style. By providing examples of past successes, the AI can now replicate my tone, emoji usage, and bilingual structure perfectly.

### Why it's a Specialist Skill
Generic AI sounds like a robot. A Specialist knows how to provide "Golden Examples" so the AI sounds like a local community leader.

### Key Pattern
- **Header:** Descriptive Emoji + Bold Title.
- **Body:** Direct, encouraging Kreyòl.
- **Footer:** Call to action or community hashtag.
