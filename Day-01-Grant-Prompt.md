# Day 1: Advanced Prompt Engineering
**Project:** Haitian Agricultural Grant Assistant

### The Goal
To create a high-level system that helps Haitian NGOs secure international funding by translating local needs into professional, investor-ready language.

### The Logic (The Prompt)
> **Role:** Expert Grant Consultant for "Haiti Grow."
> **Context:** The organization is seeking $20,000 for solar-powered irrigation in the Artibonite Valley.
> **Task:** Create a 5-slide Pitch Deck Outline for international donors.
> **Rules:** > 1. Use "Investment" language, not "Charity" language.
> 2. Highlight the 15-farm impact.
> 3. Emphasize "Community-Led Sustainability" over political instability.
> 4. Focus on "Climate Resilient" technology.
> **Format:** 5-slide visual outline.

### Specialist Insight
By using **Negative Constraints** (e.g., "Do not focus on instability") and **Specific Geographic Context** (Artibonite Valley), I ensured the AI produced a strategic document rather than a generic one.
